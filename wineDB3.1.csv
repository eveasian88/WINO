Coupled with the Mediterranean climate of long, hot, dry summers and the rot-inhibiting Mistral wind, our vineyard is the perfect environment for berry maturation, giving a pure expression of terroir.
Lunatique is our prestige cuvee made from a parcel of Grenache planted in 1910. It is only made in exceptional years and has extended ageing potential.
VINIFICATION: The grapes are hand-harvested into small containers, then crushed but not destemmed. Wild yeast fermentation and maceration for 4 weeks in open barrels (600L demi muid). The mature stems have been kept in order to naturally aerate the must during fermentation, allowing us to bring different nuances of tannin and acidity to the wine. Malolactic fermentation and maturation in aged French oak demi-muid for 30 months. Hand bottled at the Domaine by gravity and without filtration. Minimal sulphite addition.
TASTING NOTES:
Colour: Deepest garnet.
Nose: Ripe black fruits, plum pudding and warm spices.
Palate: Full-bodied and velvety with dark berry flavours carrying on from the nose, evolving to hints of coffee and black forest gateau. Excellent balance and well-structured tannins, coupled with a pleasing freshness, give this wine great length.

Comments
Beautiful golden dress with fine and lively bubbles.
The nose is expressive, with notes of toasted hazelnuts and yellow fruits (apricot, mirabelle).
The wine presents a beautiful and franck mouth, with a beautiful ample fruit taste, resting on a minimalist but very accurate balance sugar-acid.
Champagne and Food Paring

Oysters
Fresh or smoked salmon toast
Vegetable and fish verrines, and salted crumble
Shrimp brochette with curry

Having gone through various vintages and seen how the wine ages the best way to describe it is that it shares characteristics of great Burgundian Pinot Noir and also Barolo. While young the wine does share many similarities to Nebbiolo, from color to high acidity, as it ages it gains the complexity of older Barolo and bridges the gap between older Barolos and Burgundies.The style of the wine is elegantly rustic. It is a wine where the acidity is brash and the usage of oak initially seems to be quite high. As it ages the wine absorbs it, then earthy notes, funkiness, and dried floral aromas appear along with aromatic spices. A very food friendly wine, in fact,it fairs better with food when young, and as it ages the options for pairing increase. "
