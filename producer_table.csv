-Grapes varieties: Pinot Noir and Chardonnay (Noble grapes only)","History of the Labruyère Family started in 1850, when the founder of the Macon family branch, Jean-Marie, settles down in Les Thorins, which became part of the Moulin-à-Vent appellation in 1924. Since then, every generation has contributed to the preservation and the development of this viticultural treasure. Jean-Pierre Labruyère, President of Labruyère Eberlé Group for more than 30 years, passed the reins of the estate to his son Edouard in 2008, in order to create a leading winery in the appellation. 
In 1988, Jean-Pierre Labruyère took over the control of the prestigious Domaine Jacques Prieur with a group of investors, to protect this Burgundian jewel.
And the story doesn’t end here. In 1992, Jean-Pierre Labruyere becomes the first Burgundian owner to invest in Bordeaux as he acquired 18 hectares of the best terroirs in Pomerol; it was a new start for Château Rouget.
In 2012 the Labruyère family decided to complete its mosaic of terroirs with vineyards in Verzenay, a Champagne Grand Cru village renowned for its Pinot Noir, one of the region’s greatest.
Owning the vineyards at our four estates, we are able to master each stage in the wine-growing and winemaking processes.

Dom. de Bel Air,1635,"Wine growers since 1635 and thirteen generations,
in the heart of the Pouilly Fumé vineyard
Difficult to know before that by the parish archives, unfortunately disparate. The vineyard was then very fragmented, divided between many owners, renting or exploiting their own vineyards. The plots were very small as evidenced by the notarial acts. But going up the Sadon lineal family (maiden name of our grandmother Raymonde), we can identify a Pierre Sadon, ""vigneron"" in 1635 in the parish of Pouilly.
Then five successive generations of Sadon mentioned ""vigneron à Pouilly"" in parish and municipal archives. In the early 1800, there are two generations of Sadon both ""vignerons"" and ""pontonniers"" (that is to say ""passeur"" de Loire) in the hamlet of Charenton, village of Pouilly.
Our great-great grandfather, Louis Sadon, left Charenton to settle vigneron in le Bouchot in the late nineteenth century when he married Marie Chollet. She herself inherited some of her parents' various bits of vines. Together they created the current Domaine de Bel Air.
Their only son André Sadon nicknamed ""Riquette"", born in 1900, was a great precursor to the forefront of new technology of the time (tying ...). He made great improvements to the domaine.
He initiated his son in law Lucien Mauroy and daughter Raymonde as good winemakers. The 1940 years were marked by war and occupation and the 50s were painful for the vineyard, especially in le Bouchot, facing south and east that had to suffer almost annually frost or hail.
It took a lot of courage and perseverance to survive and then remain faithful to an exciting job but subject to the vagaries of nature.","Gérard joined them at the end of the 1960's. With his wife Simone, he carried out a lot of modernization in the vineyard and the cellar (new tanks, thermoregulation,...) in order to keep on improving the quality of our wines.
He also welcomed the new generation represented by Katia and Cedric in the mid 90s, in parallel with new plantings, diverse cultural practices (cover crops, thinning ...), an expansion of the winery, a new vintage reception, a change of vat ...

“My approach to winemaking is to harmonise the modern methods taught in Australia with the traditions and styles of France. This has ultimately led to the decision to be based in the southern Rhone region, where the unique terroir and local grape varieties can create wines of rich primary fruit flavours and depth, which, when augmented by maturation in aged oak barrels, produces wines of elegance, balance and complexity.”

Tetramythos,2004,"Located in the village of Ano Diacopto, in Aigialeia slopes, an equipped winery, with state of the art machinery, in a beautiful building, which fits perfectly with the surrounding mountainous area. The vineyards are planted mostly with indigenous Greek along with some international grape varieties, following absolutely organic cultivation.","The Spanos brothers Aristos and Stathis, originated from Ano Diacopto were involved in grape growing and wine production early in their lives. In 1999 they meet Panayiotis Papagiannopoulos, a local also, talented and highly inspired winemaker, who joined the team. In the years that follow together they produce the first bottles of Tetramythos, new vineyards are planted and in 2003 starts the construction of a tasteful winery which is completed in 2004.
Their philosophy is the combination of scientific knowledge and traditional methods in order to produce high quality wines, in the most natural possible way, with low intervention and additives, typical of the special regional terroir.","Aristides Spanos, Stathis Spanos, Panayiotis Papagiannopoulos",,35,"200,000 bottles",Ano Diacopto,Peloponnese,Achaia,Greece
VAENI,1983,"The Co-operative was inaugurated in 1983 but the winery was actually built in 1984 and the first commercial vintage took place during that year. Increased production was one of the reasons that have led to the establishment of the Co-operative, which could act as a counterbalance for private companies. In 1984, the most radically designed winery in the Balkans was built at record speed, following brave endeavour from its members and support from the government. The Co-operative originally counted 330 members that grew 65% of the Naoussa viticultural zone.

The aim was to ensure better income for farmers whose single variety was Xinomavro. New, up-to-date wine making technology combined with age-old tradition have created the V.Q.P.R.D. wines: Naoussa, Naoussa Reserve, Naoussa Grande Reserve

Meanwhile, research was in progress for production of new wines made from Xinomavro. This is how the Rose wine was created, which won distinction within the following year and was awarded first prize in the 9th European Salon of Wine.

After trial-and-error research on vinification methods, we spotted that Xinomavro was ideally suited to making white wines bearing excellent characteristics and in 1992 Imeros White was launched in the market.

In 1994, having one of the best vintages on record, we produced Damaskinos V.Q.P.R.D. wine, aged in new French oak barrels with high toasting. This particular wine gains most favourable comments, wins distinction in Germany at the PROWEIN FAIR in 2000 and receives the silver medal at the International Wine Fair of Thessaloniki in 2004.

Then the time comes for Dogmatikos White, sourced from Xinomavro, fermented at very low temperature (8-10oC) with the use of special wine yeast starter cultures. A wine full of character and class.

Meanwhile, new cultivars are planted by our vine growers, such as Roditis, Syrah and Merlot. As a result, the Co-op enriches its range of wines produced. In 2001 and 2003 the company releases Syrah 2000 Regional Wine of Macedonia and Imeros Red Regional Wine of Macedonia respectively. Imeros Red is sourced from 50% Xinomavro and 50% Syrah and has taken up a significant share of the market.

Experimental programmes definitely do not stop here and, taking into consideration the market trends, we make efforts to produce wines that will satisfy customers' tastes.","Every 4 years in the past and every 5 now, elections are held and the new board of members is elected.

The government compensated the family for the land and they bought what now is the Diamantakos 'Ktima' vineyards and winery. The vineyards consist of two indigenous Greek grape varietals, Xinomavro and Preknadi.","George Diamantakos is third generation winemaker. His grandfather and father planted the grapes in the 80s, to then begin making their own wine by the 90s. George grew up working the vineyards with them and went off to study oenology, where his passion for winemaking began.

Methymnaeos,1985,"According to Archestratus (4th century BC), an ancient poet and connoisseur, the wine of Lesvos was the best of antiquity:

I can praise the wines produced in many places
And their names I do not forget
But no wine is compared to the wine of Lesvos

                       (quoted by Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, A, 52d)

Unfortunately, the famous, age-old winemaking tradition of Lesvos came to an end in the beginning of the 20th century because of phylloxera's arrival to the island. This vine-root eating bug had been spreading from its native America almost everywhere since the middle of the 19th century. The remedy against phylloxera in most parts of the world was to graft vines on rootstock resistant to the bug. However, Lesvos by the end of the 19th century had specialized in ouzo, made from alcohol produced elsewhere, so vineyards on the island were abandoned when hit by phylloxera.

In the early 1980s the Lambrou family discovered the last remaining vines of an old grape of Lesvos near Chidira, a forgotten village of the island. The grape, named after the village Chidiriotiko, was replanted in 1985 by the Lambrou family in their private estate, located in the crater of the extinct volcano close to Chidira. The lava of this volcano had once created the Petrified Forest of Lesvos.","In 1997 the Lambrou family completed construction of Methymnaeos Winery, located, too, in Chidira. The first bottles of Methymnaeos Organic Wine, of the harvest of 1997, came out of the winery's production line in 1999. This was the first bottled wine in the history of Lesvos. 

Nowdays Yannis Lambrou, son of the family, processes at Methymnaeos Winery his own grapes and the grapes of other local vine growers, who, following the steps of the Lambrou family, have decided to replant and recultivate Chidiriotiko.

Castell d'Age,1988,"The Castell d’Age cellars are the original creation of women belonging to the Junyent family, in a place blessed by the Gods. Set in the Penedès countryside, sheltering under the Mediterranean sky. Here we have been making organic wines and cavas of the highest quality, from the very start. Products, originating from the land and the rain, which aim to touch upon the high point of our sense perceptions.

Over 20 years ago, Anne Marie began to cultivate and produce our organic wines and cavas. As the new generation follows her footsteps, we have gone one step further with a move to biodynamic agriculture, a method that respects the relationship between man and earth. The results are there to be seen. There in the taste.

We started tending and caring for our vineyards over 50 years ago. Castell d’Age currently owns six estates. Located in the Penedès DO. Made up of different types of soil and situated at varying altitudes. So that each variety finds the most suitable environment, where it can express its great potential.

Castell d’Age wines and cavas are produced in the bodegas just as the vines are grown in the vineyard: respecting E.U. organic regulations. Patiently. We have all the time in the world…",,Olivia Junyent,"Olga Betrián, winemaker",140,"130,000 Bottles",Piera,PENEDÉS,,Spain
Frontonio,2010,"
Frontonio is named after Saint Frontonio, the patrón saint of Épila, a town in Valdejalón, North-East Spain, where it is produced. Legend has it that Saint Frontonio was beheaded by the Romans. His body was buried in a cemetery and his head was thrown into the River Ebro near Zaragoza. Miraculously, his head was later found going upstream along the banks of the River Jalón in Épila. Likewise, this limited production of “micro” wine is the result of rowing against the stream. It is also something of a miracle. It comes from a humble garage where it is made by Fernando Mora MW, Francisco Latasa and Mario López without any fuss.","

Aphros,2004,"Aphros winery is the brainchild of Lisbon architect Vasco Croft who decided to explore his passion for wine in a XVII century family estate located in the Vinho Verde Region. 
Interested in Steiner’s philosophy since his youth, and having led the Waldorf education movement in Portugal for many years, he naturally follows the path of biodynamics.
Mountain horses, sheep, bees and special water cascades are part of the farm life. The vines, carefully managed through cover crops, are treated with home made plant extracts. Being made from brandy, these preparations have their origin in the same vines they are destined to treat.
The wines, ranging from still to classic method sparkling and Pet Nats, are based on local varieties Loureiro and Vinhão and made with low intervention protocols, using only indigenous yeasts and a minimum of sulphites. 
They have achieved worldwide recognition and are distributed in over 20 countries in all continents.
In 2015 Vasco opened two new cellars; one contemporary cellar dedicated to the classical range of wines and a medieval cellar for the production of artisanal wines in amphorae without the use of electricity, under the brand Phaunus.
","Born in Lisbon with an inclination for metaphysics, Vasco thought of being an astrologer in his teens, then decided to become an architect. In his twenties he discovered Steiner’s philosophy, and went on to study pedagogy and sculpture in England, where he also discovered an interest in woodworking and furniture design. On his come back to Portugal, he led the Waldorf movement for many years alongside with his own furniture design company. In his thirties he had a life changing encounter with a Buddhist monk, where a bottle of wine was shared. This event, taken by Vasco as a personal meeting with Dionysus, led him in 2003 to start a wine project in Casal do Paço, a semi-abandoned property belonging to his family since the 17th century. A confessed convert to Biodynamics and Dionysism, there are (undeserved!) suspicions that Vasco is a Faun in disguise, living a delightful decadent life in the winery surrounded by beautiful Nymphs – while wishing this would be true, he tries to cope with the manifold hardships of running a winery.",Vasco Croft,"Consultant WineMaker - Tiago SAmpaio.
